## Proof of  concept 

### Accuracy of Jump-seq assessed with synthetic DNA

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="Fig 1.1, Number of reads (in million on y axis) at different sites, 5hmC (red) and unmodified C (blue), whose numbers are in brackets."}
CPM=matrix(nrow=1, ncol=2)
CPM[1,]=c(22, 0.78)
colnames(CPM)=c("5hmC", "Unmodified C")
barplot(CPM, col=c("red", "blue"), ylim=c(0, 24), ylab="Number of reads (million)", beside=T)
text(1.5, 23, "22.00 (1)")
text(3.5, 2, "0.78 (72)")
```




###  Quantification of 5hmC: linear correlation of read counts vs. 5hmC amount

### Visualization 
Figure: IGV view, show peaks at different DNA levels, also show peaks from Tab-seq or Nano-seal. See Figure 1B of Nano-seal paper. 


### Spatial distribution 


The reference is GSM882244_FDR_0.0484. First got non-overlapping 5hmC regions and make sure each window has only one 5hmC site. For each window, count the reads depth at every site, then add up reads depth of these non-overlapping windows. Reads distribution is the accumulative reads depth at every base of all non-overlapping windows. Input Bam file is the replicate with largest number of reads.
